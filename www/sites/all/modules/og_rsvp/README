Organic groups RSVP

Implements RSVP module at the group level. When creating an event you can choose a group the event belongs to. For each group that you select OG RSVP will add those group members to the attendee list, send an e-mail notification (not on by default), and allow group members to confirm their attendance status at any time.

If you remove a member from a group, that member will be removed from all future events for that group.  If you add a member to a group, that member will be added to all future events for that group and receive e-mail notifications for each event. New group members will not have to go searching for upcoming events that they did not originally receive the e-mail on.

E-mail notification can be customized on the OG RSVP settings page.

OG RSVP also has Views 2.x functionality. Create lists for pending events for the logged in user, etc...


Questions

1. Why is the attendance status form right smack in the middle of the node?

This was a design decision that I had not originally anticpated. I had first created the module to use a local task called 'RSVP', but this was not user-friendly enough for the audience.

2. Is this a fork of RSVP?

I took a look at RSVP in July 2008, and thought about porting it to Drupal 6, but did not have enough time allotted to undertake a project of that size. So I designed and implemented a rsvp module for events integrated with Organic groups per specification.

OG RSVP will not develop into a duplicate RSVP module. It will only be maintained as a module bridging the audience of an event node with a rsvp system. Adding specific users, e-mail addresses, or roles is outside the scope of this module.
