description = "Authentication for web-based applications allows the application
		to access a Google service protected by a user's Google account. To maintain
		a high level of security, the Authentication Proxy interface, AuthSub,
		enables the application to get an authentication token without ever handling
		the user's account login information. Using the proxy service, the user of
		your web application logs into their account through a Google-supplied login
		page and consents to grant limited access to the web application."
