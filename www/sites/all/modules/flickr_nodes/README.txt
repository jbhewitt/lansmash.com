Flickr nodes
============

This Drupal module makes it possible to associate nodes with Flickr tags. This
makes it possible to allow users to seamlessly add photos to content in your
Drupal site using Flickr. All nodes, of the content types you enable, recieves
a unique Flickr machinetag that you can then use to tag photos with.

Nodes of an enabled content type will be given  a photos section, where you can
browse all photos associated with it. A block will also be available, in which
you chose to show a short selection of photos for the current node.

For more information, please see http://drupal.org/project/flickr_nodes.
