Drupal nodewords.module (aka Meta tags) README.txt
==============================================================================

This module allows users to add HTML HEAD META tags to several pages. Some
meta tags, such as KEYWORDS, may help in SEO (Search Engine Optimisation)
if you try not to lie.

This version is for Drupal 6.x only. It will not work on Drupal 5.x or
earlier and probably also not on Drupal 7.x or later.

This version is a complete rewrite. IT IS NOT READY YET. IT DOES NOT DO
ANYTHING YET. IT IS UNSTABLE. IF YOU UPGRADE FROM nodewords-6.x-1.x OR FROM
nodewords-5.x-1.x ALL DATA WILL BE LOST! DO NOT USE ON PRODUCTION SITES!

The alpha-code is only shared to allow others to see the way the module is
going, to allow others to test and maybe comment and to take advantage of
the Drupal.org CVS server.

I can't repeat this enough: DO NOT USE AT ALL!
